# SnakeGame
This is a game making by Python. 
You need to control the snake to eat the apples by keys 'Up'/'Down'/'Left'/'Right'. 
After ate the apple, the score will increase by 1 and the snake will be longer and faster. 
Don't let the snake hit the walls or itself because it will die. 
# Attentions
Instead of the shortcut of the game, please don't move any files in the 'SnakeGame' file. 
You can also change the sounds to your own mp3 files with the name 'eatfood'(play when ate the food) and 'gameover'(play when the snake died).
# Deatails
You can also pressing the keys '1'(slow)-'5'(fast) to change the speed, '3' is the original speed. 
# Hidden function
If you put your mouse in the game window and the snake hit the mouse, it will carry your mouse and run away!
